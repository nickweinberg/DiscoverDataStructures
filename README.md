# Discover Data Structures
[to be determined].herokuapp.com (maybe?)

# What

A set of interactive animations to teach CS newbies about data structures. I will start with stacks, queues, and trees. I will then move on to prefix trees and hash tables.

# Why

I'm a visual learner, and I hope to help other visual learners with diagrams that are interactive and animated in such a way that makes data structures as clear as possible.

# How

- D3.js
  - data visualizations
  - animations
- Angular
  - single-page web app
- Compass
  - CSS pre-processing
- Foundation
  - CSS framework
  - grid-based responsive design

# When

TBD

# Where

I will probably try to host the end result on GitHub Pages

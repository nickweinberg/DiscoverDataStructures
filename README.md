data-structures-d3
==================

# What

A set of interactive animations to teach CS newbies about data structures. I will start with stacks, queues, and trees. I will then move on to prefix trees and hash tables.

# Why

I'm a visual learner, and I hope to help other visual learners with diagrams that are interactive and animated in such a way that makes data structures as clear as possible.

# How

- D3.js
- maybe Backbone or Angular just to explore more front-end MV*
- Stylus or Compass
- maybe a CSS framework like Foundation or Boostrap for responsive design

# When

TBD

# Where

I will probably try to host the end result on GitHub Pages
